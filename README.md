## React TodoList 
[Click here for Demo](https://shangan23.github.io/react-todos/)

This project is an experimental and below are the learnings:

### React

- Class(stateful since all the react lifecycle methods will be invoked for each component) and Functional(stateless & effective performance) components
- Passing props to React functional component - in functional component pass `props` as a parameter and use it.
- Calling method of parent component using props. 
- Passing parameter to parent component using bind(`this`,`<parameters>`)
- Router (react-router-dom) - BrowserRouter, Route(path, component, render), Link(to)

### Javascript 

- Arrow, Normal function - `this.props` context within class component cannot be accessesed without binding `this` for custom functions. But arrow function can access `this.props` without binding.
- Higher order array methods - map & filters
- Spread operator [ ...] for copying the exsisting array, modifiying, adding...etc

### CSS
- Fluid design
