This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Todo

This project is an experimental project:

1. React Basics - Class and Functional components
2. Arrow, Normal function - `this` context within React class component cannot be accessesed without binding `this`. But arrow function can acess `this`
3. Passing props to React functional component - in functional component pass `props` as a parameter and use it.
4. Calling method of parent component using props. 
5. Passing parameter to parent component using bind(`this`,`<parameters>`)
6. Higher order array methods - map & filters
