This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React Todo [Demo](https://shangan23.github.io/react-todos/)

This project is an experimental project:

### React

1.  - Class(stateful since all the react lifecycle methods will be invoked for each component) and Functional(stateless & effective performance) components
2. Passing props to React functional component - in functional component pass `props` as a parameter and use it.
3. Calling method of parent component using props. 
4. Passing parameter to parent component using bind(`this`,`<parameters>`)

### Javascript 

1. Arrow, Normal function - `this.props` context within class component cannot be accessesed without binding `this` for custom functions. But arrow function can access `this.props` without binding.
2. Higher order array methods - map & filters
3. Spread operator [ ...] for copying the exsisting array, modifiying, adding...etc
